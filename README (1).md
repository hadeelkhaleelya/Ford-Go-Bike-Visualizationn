# Ford-Go-Bike-Visualization
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Ford GoBike bike-sharing system data, focusing on usage patterns during February 2019 in the San Francisco Bay Area. The project is divided into two main parts: data wrangling and analysis, and visualization.

## Part I: Data Wrangling and Analysis

This section involves a thorough examination of the dataset, which includes 183,412 entries and 16 features such as trip duration, start and end times, start and end locations, and user demographics. The main objectives are to:

- **Understand the Structure of the Data:** Explore and clean the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and converting date columns to the appropriate format.
- **Key Features Identification:** Focus on trip duration, user type, and start hour to uncover significant patterns and insights.
- **Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis:** Investigate how different variables interact with each other, such as the effect of user type on trip duration and the relationship between start hour and trip behavior.

## Part II: Visualization and Presentation

This part of the project presents key findings through a series of visualizations that illustrate user behavior and system usage patterns:

- **Distribution of Trip Durations by User Type:** A bar chart that reveals customers tend to have longer and more varied trip durations compared to subscribers.
- **Peak Usage Hours by User Type:** A line chart highlighting peak usage hours, showing that subscribers typically use the service during commuting hours, while customers have more varied usage throughout the day.
- **Trip Duration and Start Hour Interaction:** A heatmap demonstrating the interaction between trip duration and start hour for each user type, emphasizing the different usage patterns between customers and subscribers.

### Key Insights

- **User Behavior:** Customers generally take longer trips and have more varied usage patterns compared to subscribers.
- **Peak Usage:** Subscribers mostly use the service during peak commuting hours, while customers exhibit diverse usage throughout the day.
- **Service Optimization:** These insights can inform improvements in bike availability, maintenance schedules, and targeted marketing strategies.

## Conclusion

This project not only explores the Ford GoBike dataset to uncover usage patterns but also provides visual insights that could be useful for optimizing the bike-sharing system's operations and user experience. The code and visualizations are organized to be clear, informative, and reusable for further analysis or presentation.
